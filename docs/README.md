This repository generates the slides for my 2025 NHS RPysoc conference keynote, which will be delivered on Friday 14th November 2025.

This talk covers a series of recommended habits for improving the reusability of code projects.

This has been generatd with Quarto version 1.7.33, outputting a RevealJS presentation which is hosted on Github pages.

No specific python packages are required for generating the file.

Running `quarto render` from the root will update the file docs/index.html and all associated files.

Alternatively, run `quarto preview RPySOC-2025-keynote.qmd` to open up a preview in the development server.
