# Picture a Scene

I want you to picture a scene.

::: notes

You've been asked to do something pretty complex, pretty quickly. It also sounds like something someone else will have worked on before. It's got that sense of 'this isn't just an "us" problem'.

So you go out and ask around on - say, the NHS-R Slack - if this is something someone else has worked on.

And you get the response - "yes!".

(but it was at my previous job and I wasn't allowed to share the code, so I don't have it anymore. But you could try asking so-and-so, and here's a bit of a rough guide of what we did. )

And I will fully admit I've been the people on both sides of this conversation. Where I've done something I think will be of use, but life's then got in the way, and I can't spare the time to go back into a project to polish it up properly - because I was too busy.

::: notes

Now that we've established that hopefully familiar narrative, who am I to try and propose a solution?

So, I'm Sammi Rosser. I had my first taste of "proper" coding about 14 years ago, in the deep dark ages of base R, but I've been coding in earnest for about 10 years now. These days it's mostly Python, but I'm astill  big fan of R too.

I have an MSc in health data science, and spent two years working as a data analyst and then data scientist in a mental health trust where some people from this community had really laid some amazing R foundations in the team. And I came to my first NHS-R conference in 2022, I was just completely in awe of all the amazing things people were doing. So I spent my time at the coal face of data, automating reports, writing a script to automate the upload of 80,000 documents after an EPR outage. What I'm trying to say is, as we go through this talk - I know the realities, and the time pressures, and the priorities of data work in the NHS.

But my passion is sharing the joy of code with other people - so I joined the Health Service Modelling Associates programme in 2023. So now I get to teach people all the really fun, interesting and impactful things they can do with code, and I get to do a lot of coding, including recently on a big complex cross-organisation modelling projects to keep my skills sharp.

:::

# The Problem

::: notes

And I get to meet loads of amazing people across different organisations. 9 months of the programme, people work on projects. People have been doing amazing things with their projects, and this has been true of HSMA for years.

<https://hsma.co.uk/previous_projects/projects_with_code>
:::

::: notes
And last year, I was revamping our website to try and help our students come up with ideas around 'what sorts of projects can I do?'. And I was looking at all this code that's been written by our community and shared over the years

But even where the code was shared, we just weren't getting people reusing it as much as I would have liked. Now, maybe it's partly an awareness thing.

But even people within the HSMA community, even when they had the same problem, even when we could direct them to a previous repo - they would end up starting from scratch each time.

:::

## Same few things - same quick(ish) solutions

:::

And looking at them, I kept seeing the same things that trip up a lot of people newer to coding and open source

These are issues not unique to our projects and students - these are things you see time and time again in open source projects, but they're resolvable if you get into some good habits.

And they're the things that can really help level up your projects. Many of them aren't that time consuming - and they will save you time in the future.

And that's the main thing I want to talk you through today - if we're going to reach the utopia that people in previous years have talked about - like Rhian Davies's fantastic talk from last year - what are some of the practical things we can all start doing by default?

In this talk, I want to convince you of why you should bother with each of these things.

I don't have time to take you through all the details of the how - but head to my website and you can find a blog post with all of the juicy details.

## LICENCE

:::{.fragment .editable}
If you don't have a Licence, I can't reuse your code!
:::

## {.slide data-menu-title="The usual ask"}

::: {.rstack}

![](assets/2025-11-04-16-16-57.png){.fragment}

:::

::: notes
- A licence is the first and most fundamental step towards reusability.
- Once you know a few of them, you can chuck one in there from the start.
- LICENCE or LICENCE.md = special file that will be displayed by github
- If you don't have one, I **cannot** reuse your code
  - [default law = no rights to use, modify, etc.](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/)
- If you create it via Github, it helps you choose one and make the file!
- MIT is a pretty decent option
- [ChooseALicence](https://choosealicense.com/) helps if you're unsure

:::



## README

:::{.fragment .editable}
If you don't have a README, your code will be left on the shelf
:::


::: notes
README.md is a special file because Github will display it.

Use it to tell me how to run your code, what inputs I need, etc. - all the key important stuff I need to know if I want to run it myself. What's in all those folders?

:::

## Bonus - README of me

::: {.incremental}

- make a repo with a name that's your GitHub username
- just make a README.md file in there and commit it
- use it to tell me all the cool stuff you're working on and why I should care

:::

![](assets/2025-11-03-16-40-25.png)


::: notes

As someone trying to employ coders, I won't penalise you for not having one, but it'll certainly help me understand your work above and beyond pinned repositories

:::

## Docstrings

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}

![](assets/2025-11-03-17-23-32.png)

:::

::: {.column width='50%'}

- for Python, [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard) = best (IMO)
- for R, [roxygen]() and [docstring]()
- If you're allowed, AI tools can do great first drafts
- Also IDE extensions for setting up a template


:::

::::


::: notes

Docstrings are the easiest way to level up your code - for you and others.

They're basically super-comments that the tools you write your code in - your IDE, like RStudio or VSCode, will display.

In python, lots of formats - choose one you like and stay consistent

In R, roxygen2 and the 'docstring' package

## Automatic Linting

- I will not be reading your code if it's written like this...

TODO: Add gif of a very long line

- Safe linters are available for all good languages and IDEs
  - Install [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for Python
  - Install [styler](https://styler.r-lib.org/index.html) for R in RStudio
  - Activate [air](https://positron.posit.co/migrate-rstudio-code.html) for R code in Positron
  - Use [lintquarto](https://github.com/lintquarto/lintquarto) for Python code in Quarto docs
- Format on save = never deal with this again

::: notes

And it just helps save time - which you can use on other parts of this list!

:::


## Folder structure

- Changing the way you structure your code in your repo makes automated documentation and packaging just work more easily


::: notes
I had to completely restructure something recently and it was a colossal pain
:::



# A mindset shift - packaging your code

I think it's easy to see packages as something for 'other people'

For 'advanced coders'

But it's like any other coding task

# The Final Hurdle

## Those same old questions

:::{.incremental}
- What will our demand look like next year?
- How long will our waiting lists be?
- Will we meet target x?
:::

## The better questions

:::{.incremental}
- What do we need and where to be able to **meet** the demand?
- Who aren't we serving?
:::



::: notes

I worked in a trust with some brilliant people, but I was still pretty new to all of this.

One of my biggest frustrations was being asked questions that I just didn't know the right way to answer... but I was sure someone out there would have thought about this before.

These generally came under a few categories.
- What's going to happen to our demand?
- What's going to happen to our waiting lists?
- Are we going to meet target x?

And then there were also lots of *better* questions I wanted to be able to answer.

- What can we do to fix this?
- Who aren't we serving?

And you can't look at that list and tell me we don't all have these same questions.

We have different systems, and different pathways, but I'm far from the first person to be standing up here yelling about having the same problems and repeated solutions.

And it actually makes me a little mad because we shouldn't, in 2025, be experiencing a postcode lottery of whether our trust has a data science team, and advanced analytics capabilities. I know if I was treated in trust X it's by a team who are making advanced predictions of demand, and I'm going to be seen in a more timely manner.

Since I joined the NHS, I've been trying to find all the good stuff

NHS R conference, HACA conference, SWAIH conference, SWAIH South West Hub, LinkedIn, starring over 1300 Github repos, working out which individuals and organisations to follow on GitHub. Attending HaCORN and HaCORN special interest groups and NHS-R webinars and HSMA showcases and ApHA stuff and reading NHS-R and Pycom and subscribing to newsletters and talking to academics and the strategy unit and ...

## It's just not sustainable!

![](assets/2025-11-03-18-10-29.png){.absolute width=0px height=0px left=40px top=118px}

::: notes

There just isn't enough time (and brainspace) for us all to be constantly trying to do this.

And that's just locked in my head.

How many of us are trying to do the same thing and build up knowledge that would be better externalised?

And I'm not saying that we get rid of any of these things because each and every one of them is wonderful and a necessary part of this huge puzzle that is modern analytics in the NHS - but

We don't just need to get things into packages.

We need to get them out there into the hands of the people who need them.

And we have pockets of it.
- the HSMA website, which you can filter down to projects with shard code
- the fabulous NHS-R website and books
- bits and pieces on github
- maybe things I can't see (like AnalystX)

There are so many parts to that puzzle slowly going together, but I still don't feel like I have that 'magic book' that I felt must exist when I started my NHS journey.

So I've begun to write that.
