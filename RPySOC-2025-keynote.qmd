## Picture a Scene

I want you to picture a scene.

You've been asked to do something pretty complex, pretty quickly. It also sounds like something someone else will have worked on before. It's got that sense of 'this isn't just an "us" problem'.

So you go out and ask around on - say, the NHS-R Slack - if this is something someone else has worked on.

And you get the response - "yes!".

(but it was at my previous job and I wasn't allowed to share the code, so I don't have it anymore. But you could try asking so-and-so, and here's a bit of a rough guide of what we did. )

## About Me

::: notes

But who am I to come in here and tell you to do this?

We'll rewind a bit. I've been writing code a while now. I got my first taste of coding about 13 years ago. We were simulating the population dynamics of lizards in base R - before the tidyverse came along and changed our world (image of Hadley Wickham?).
(RETURN TO THIS LATER - HOW TIDYVERSE CHANGED EVERYTHING)

I got a job completely unrelated to code... or so I thought. Then I saw what people in the organisation were doing with it.

So I spend between Christmas and New Year of 2014 working my way through udemy courses on R, and from then, I was hooked. Python followed, with me squeezing it into my day job in every way I could manage.

This culminated in me doing a health data science MSc.

And this is where I started to meet some really cool and inspiring people.

(Simon W-M, Lee Coulson, NHS E demand and capacity team, Tom Monks)

And I ended up in a trust!

And, bright eyed and eager, I turned up to my first NHS-R conference in 2022 - and I think it's fair to say my mind was a little bit blown (and it's the most immense privilege to be here talking to you like this today).

:::



## My time in the NHS

::: notes

I worked in a trust with some brilliant people, but I was still pretty new to all of this.

One of my biggest frustrations was being asked questions that I just didn't know the right way to answer... but I was sure someone out there would have thought about this before.

These generally came under a few categories.
- What's going to happen to our demand?
- What's going to happen to our waiting lists?
- Are we going to meet target x?

And then there were also lots of *better* questions I wanted to be able to answer.

- What can we do to fix this?
- Who aren't we serving?

And you can't look at that list and tell me we don't all have these same questions.

We have different systems, and different pathways, but I'm far from the first person to be standing up here yelling about having the same problems and repeated solutions.

And it actually makes me a little mad because we shouldn't, in 2025, be experiencing a postcode lottery of whether our trust has a data science team, and advanced analytics capabilities. I know if I was treated in trust X it's by a team who are making advanced predictions of bed demand, and
:::


## And now

::: notes

And that brings me to where I am now, on the HSMA programme.

I knew these better techniques were there, and I wanted to share them with as many people as possible, and joining the HSMA teaching team was the way to do that.

And so now I get to work with amazing people from across over a hundred trusts, and say for sure - we do all have a lot of the same problems. Even this year, we had multiple projects registered trying to solve the same thing - but despite our best efforts, separately.

And one project stuck with me...

It was a brilliant project with a lot of impact, and the next year, we had a group wanting to do the same thing, and maybe build on it a bit.

So they went to use the code (which was available!)...

And then they started again.

It wasn't bad code. It just wasn't designed to be reusable.

## Hello World

What do you tend to do every time you start a new script?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}

```{=python}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
```

:::

::: {.column width='50%'}

```{=r}

## Or even...

::: {.column width='50%'}

```{=r}
library(NHSRplotthedots)

## What else do they have in common?

## What does the shift need to be?

Shared
Licenced
Documented
Tested
Versioned
Maintained
Collaborative
Advertised

And packaged?


::: notes
Shared = on GitHub
Licenced = an appropriate licence so people can reuse it without getting into trouble
Documented = clear documentation on how to use it
Tested = Actual tests with a framework
Versioned = Make actual versions so you know what you're getting into with updates
Maintained = You
Collaborative = designed for collaboration, with issues and a code of conduct
Advertised = let people know it exists
Packaged or parameterisable = installable code OR code that is designed to allow people to input their own data in some way

## The endless search


::: notes

Since I joined the NHS, I've been trying to find all the good stuff

Conferences, LinkedIn, starring Github repos, working out who to follow on GitHub. Attending HaCORN and HaCORD special interest groups and NHS-R and HSMA showcases and local networks and ApHA stuff and reading NHS-R and Pycom and watching webinars and talking to academics and the strategy unit and ...

There just isn't enough time (and brainspace) for us all to be constantly trying to do this.

[image of "how to tie your shoelaces" and "cool project that might be the solution you're looking for one day" competing for space in a brain]

And we have pockets of it.
- the HSMA website
- the NHS-R website and books

But every time there's something
:::



## My final call

::: notes

We don't just need to get things into packages.

We need to get them out there into the hands of the people who need them.

There are so many parts to that puzzle slowly going together, but I still don't feel like I have that 'magic book' that I felt must exist when I started my NHS journey.

So I've begun to write that.

## Circling back

::: notes

Now let's go back to your plea at the beginning.

Someone comes back to you with

"Yes! I had that problem and I made a package. You can install it from PyPi. Here's a link to the repo in case you want to check out that it's not doing anything dodgy, and here's documentation."

And show that same repo, but this time it's a package, with a pypi badge, and test coverage, and an issue tracker.
