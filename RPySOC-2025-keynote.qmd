# Picture a Scene

::: notes

I want you to picture a scene.

::: notes

You've been asked to do something pretty complex, pretty quickly. It also sounds like something someone else will have worked on before. It's got that sense of 'this isn't just an "us" problem'.

So you go out and ask around on - say, the NHS-R Slack - if this is something someone else has worked on.

And you get the response - "yes!".

(but it was at my previous job and I wasn't allowed to share the code, so I don't have it anymore. But you could try asking so-and-so, and here's a bit of a rough guide of what we did. )

::: notes

Now that we've established that hopefully familiar narrative, who am I to try and propose a solution?

So, I'm Sammi Rosser. I had my first taste of "proper" coding about 14 years ago, in the deep dark ages of base R, but I've been coding in earnest for about 10 years now. These days it's mostly Python, but I'm astill  big fan of R too.

I have an MSc in health data science, and spent two years working as a data analyst and then data scientist in a mental health trust where some people from this community had really laid some amazing R foundations in the team. And I came to my first NHS-R conference in 2022, I was just completely in awe of all the amazing things people were doing. So I spent my time at the coal face of data, automating reports, writing a script to automate the upload of 80,000 documents after an EPR outage. What I'm trying to say is, as we go through this talk - I know the realities, and the time pressures, and the priorities of data work in the NHS.

But my passion is sharing the joy of code with other people - so I joined the Health Service Modelling Associates programme in 2023. So now I get to teach people all the really fun, interesting and impactful things they can do with code, and I get to do a lot of coding, including recently on a big complex cross-organisation modelling projects to keep my skills sharp.

:::

# The Problem

::: notes

And I get to meet loads of amazing people across different organisations. 9 months of the programme, people work on projects. People have been doing amazing things with their projects, and this has been true of HSMA for years.

## {.slide data-menu-title="What's not happening?"}

![](assets/2025-11-05-10-16-53.png){height="600px" fig-align="center"}

<https://hsma.co.uk/previous_projects/projects_with_code>

::: notes
And last year, I was revamping our website to try and help our students come up with ideas around 'what sorts of projects can I do?'. And I was looking at all this code that's been written by our community and shared over the years

But even where the code was shared, we just weren't getting people reusing it as much as I would have liked. Now, maybe it's partly an awareness thing.

But even people within the HSMA community, even when they had the same problem, even when we could direct them to a previous repo - they would end up starting from scratch each time.

## What am I advocating?{.center}

<br>

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
Big impact on reusability
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
On balance - a time saving
:::


::: notes

And looking at them, I kept seeing the same things that trip up a lot of people newer to coding and open source

These are issues not unique to our projects and students - these are things you see time and time again in open source projects, but they're resolvable if you get into some good habits.

And they're the things that can really help level up your projects. Many of them aren't that time consuming - and they will save you time in the future.

And that's the main thing I want to talk you through today - if we're going to reach the utopia that people in previous years have talked about - like Rhian Davies's fantastic talk from last year - what are some of the practical things we can all start doing by default?

README.md is a special file because Github will display it.

Use it to tell me how to run your code, what inputs I need, etc. - all the key important stuff I need to know if I want to run it myself. What's in all those folders?

You might notice I don't talk about environments today - and that's not because it's not important, but because plenty of other people have spoken on that matter. So here I'm almost assuming you're doing that, and expecting it to be in your readme.

The 'why should I bother' is the bit I actually see being missed out the most. What will I get out of this?

But also the 'what' - is this a simulation? A forecasting library? For long term planning or short term operational use? It's often so unclear and just a couple of sentences clear that up straight away.

So a readme doesn't need to be long - but please don't just leave me with a one liner and 10 folders each with 6 notebooks in (and this is a real scenario I've encountered), because then rea

This moved away from hard coding the input data and expecting certain column names.

And split it into three separate key functions for tranforming log data into snapshots, adding icons and animation positions, and making the animation, instead of one long script.

This involved copying a load of code and keeping it up to date in multiple places and knowing loads of weird logic... so now it's just a function.

# The Final Hurdle

::: notes

I worked in a trust with some brilliant people, but I was still pretty new to all of this.

One of my biggest frustrations was being asked questions that I just didn't know the right way to answer... but I was sure someone out there would have thought about this before.

We have different systems, and different pathways, but I'm far from the first person to be standing up here yelling about having the same problems and repeated solutions.

And it actually makes me a little mad because we shouldn't, in 2025, be experiencing a postcode lottery of whether our trust has a data science team, and advanced analytics capabilities. I know if I was treated in trust X it's by a team who are making advanced predictions of demand, and I'm going to be seen in a more timely manner.

Since I joined the NHS, I've been trying to find all the good stuff

NHS R conference, HACA conference, SWAIH conference, SWAIH South West Hub, LinkedIn, starring over 1300 Github repos, working out which individuals and organisations to follow on GitHub. Attending HaCORN and HaCORN special interest groups and NHS-R webinars and HSMA showcases and ApHA stuff and reading NHS-R and Pycom and subscribing to newsletters and talking to academics and the strategy unit and ...

There just isn't enough time (and brainspace) for us all to be constantly trying to do this.

And that's just locked in my head.

How many of us are trying to do the same thing and build up knowledge that would be better externalised?

And I'm not saying that we get rid of any of these things because each and every one of them is wonderful and a necessary part of this huge puzzle that is modern analytics in the NHS - but

We don't just need to get things into packages.

We need to get them out there into the hands of the people who need them.

And we have pockets of it.
- the HSMA website, which you can filter down to projects with shard code
- the fabulous NHS-R website and books
- bits and pieces on github
- maybe things I can't see (like AnalystX)

There are so many parts to that puzzle slowly going together, but I still don't feel like I have that 'magic book' that I felt must exist when I started my NHS journey.

So I've begun to write that.
